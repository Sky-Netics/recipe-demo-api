# CloudFormation Template Changes Summary

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Resource Naming
- Changed all resource names from "RecipeApp" to "RecipeAppDemo"
- Updated all references and dependencies to match new naming
- Modified log group paths to use "recipeappdemo" instead of "recipeapp"

### 2. Removed Features (Due to Deployment Issues)
- Removed deployment circuit breaker configuration:
  ```yaml
  # Removed from ECS Service:
  DeploymentCircuitBreaker:
    Enable: true
    Rollback: true
  ```

- Removed container health check:
  ```yaml
  # Removed from Container Definition:
  HealthCheck:
    Command:
      - CMD-SHELL
      - curl -f http://localhost:5000/recipes || exit 1
    Interval: 30
    Timeout: 5
    Retries: 3
    StartPeriod: 60
  ```

- Removed ForceNewDeployment flag:
  ```yaml
  # Removed from ECS Service:
  ForceNewDeployment: true
  ```

### 3. EC2 Instance Changes
- Simplified UserData script:
  ```yaml
  # Before:
  UserData:
    Fn::Base64: !Sub |
      #!/bin/bash -xe
      echo ECS_CLUSTER=${RecipeAppCluster} >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
      echo ECS_ENABLE_CONTAINER_METADATA=true >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
      echo ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
      echo ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=120s >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
      yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap curl
      /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -v --stack ${AWS::StackId} --resource RecipeAppEC2Instance --region ${AWS::Region}
      /opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal -e $? --stack ${AWS::StackId} --resource RecipeAppEC2Instance --region ${AWS::Region}

  # After:
  UserData:
    Fn::Base64: !Sub |
      #!/bin/bash -xe
      echo ECS_CLUSTER=${RecipeAppDemoCluster} >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
      yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap
      /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -v --stack ${AWS::StackId} --resource RecipeAppDemoEC2Instance --region ${AWS::Region}
      /opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal -e $? --stack ${AWS::StackId} --resource RecipeAppDemoEC2Instance --region ${AWS::Region}
  ```

- Removed UpdatePolicy:
  ```yaml
  # Removed from EC2 Instance:
  UpdatePolicy:
    AutoScalingRollingUpdate:
      MinInstancesInService: 1
      MaxBatchSize: 1
      PauseTime: PT15M
      WaitOnResourceSignals: true
  ```

### 4. ECS Cluster Changes
- Removed CapacityProviders configuration:
  ```yaml
  # Removed from ECS Cluster:
  CapacityProviders:
    - EC2
  ```

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Simplified deployment configuration while maintaining essential settings:
  ```yaml
  # Maintained in ECS Service:
  DeploymentConfiguration:
    MaximumPercent: 200
    MinimumHealthyPercent: 50
  ```

## Impact of Changes

1. **Improved Stability**: Removing complex features like circuit breaker and health checks has made deployments more stable and less likely to fail.

2. **Simplified Updates**: The removal of UpdatePolicy and ForceNewDeployment makes the update process more straightforward and less prone to getting stuck.

3. **Resource Management**: Using "RecipeAppDemo" prefix helps distinguish these resources from any existing "RecipeApp" resources in the AWS account.

4. **Reduced Complexity**: The simplified UserData script and removal of additional ECS configurations makes the template more maintainable and less likely to encounter issues during deployment.

## Conclusion

The final template represents a more stable and simplified version that maintains core functionality while removing features that were causing deployment issues. The naming changes to "RecipeAppDemo" allow for parallel deployments without conflicting with existing resources.
